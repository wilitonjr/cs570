-----------------------------------------------------------------

How the FIFO and LRU replacement algorithms were implemented:

- First the program will call the FIFO() function top demonstrate the page replacement using this algorithme
	- The FIFO() function calls the function FIFOInsert
		- Function FIFOInsert will call the function FIFOSearch to see if the page nember is already in the memory
			- If the page is already there, it does nothing
			- Else, it returns to FIFOInsert() to insert the page into our memory. Respecting the FIFO order
		- Back to FIFOInsert() it updates our memory acordinly and returns to FIFO()
	- FIFO() function the prints the page frame and returns the page Fault Count to our main function
	
- The exatly same process is used with LRU() function. Respecting, of course, the desired behavior to replace the page in our simulated memory usuing the "Least Recently Used" pattern
	- The Least Recently Used page is found by the function LRUSearch().
		 


-----------------------------------------------------------------




- Description -

This program simulates two different page replacement algorithms: FIFO (First-in  First-out) and LRU (Least  Recently  Used). This comparison demonstrates better understanding of these two page replacement methods.



- How it works -

It gets the argumets from the user input. The arguments are Virtual Pages (ReferenceSZ) and physical pages (FrameNR).

So, each method (FIFO and LRU) will be represented properly.



- How to Run -

The following commands should be executed to run the programs:

make            // to generate testvm executable file.
./testvm [ReferenceSZ] [FrameNR]	// to run the testvm program. 



- Outputs -

The result of the programs is displayed on the screen.
